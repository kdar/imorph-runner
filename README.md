# iMorph Runner

iMorph-runner is a utility for managing and launching iMorph. It checks for updates, downloads them if available, and then runs iMorph with the latest version.

## Features

- Automatically checks for iMorph updates
- Downloads the latest iMorph release if available
- Launches iMorph after update check/download
- Configurable via TOML vile
- Supports multiple flavors and regions (e.g., Retail, Classic)
